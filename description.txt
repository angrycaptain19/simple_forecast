The forecast system is a basic and simple app that was designed to calculated the forecast using weighted moving average.

The user should input the prior 4 months of sales (or volume) and the app will calculate the moving average for the next 3 months.
The weight will be input based on 3 pre defined choices.

The result will be displayed in the screen and in a plot, that will be saved into a file in a cloud based system. An URL will be provided for the user to download the file.
